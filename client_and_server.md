<h1>Client and Server 101</h1>
<h3>Basic concept: client(a computer which web browser is on) requests and server responses</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Web server has an address and a html file(website)</li>
<li>Client requests through the address, that it wants to open the file</li>
<li>Server responses, client recieves the contents of the file</li>
<li>Browser on the client computer gets it and shows through the web page.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to use it(how to make one's own website):</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Web hosting: to use web server easily. <u>github pages</u> for example.</h4>
Using github pages, upload html file to github, then you can use web server on github server. The github server would let you know <u>the address of web server</u>.
    You can let the visitor know <u>that address</u>, the visitor will access to <u>it</u> instead of my computer.

<b>Long story short:</b> you can upload your html file, and the web hosting will take care of the rest.
</li>

<li><h4>Web server: web browser and web server on a same computer.</h4>
  <h5>To use it locally:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>You should open the server in order to make the html file on a web page.</li>
    <li>There has to be a directory to save web page(index.html)</li>
    <li>The address would be http://127.0.0.1/index.html</li>
    </ul>
  <h5>To make other computer access the website:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Get your ip and make the address into http://(your ip)/index.html</li>
    <li>Make sure both computers are using the same network.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
