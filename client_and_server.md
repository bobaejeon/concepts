<h1>Client and Server 101</h1>
-basic concept: client(a computer which web browser is on) requests and server responses

web server has an address and a html file
client requests through the address, that it wants to open the file
server responses, client recieves the contents of the file
browser on the client computer gets it and shows through the web page.

how to use it(making one's own website):
-web hosting: to use web server easily. github pages for example.
using github pages, upload html file to github, then you can use web server on github server. then the github server would let you know the address of web server.
you can let the visitor know that address, the visitor will access to it instead of my computer.

long story short: you can upload your html file, and the web hosting will take care of the rest.

-web server: web browser and web server on a same computer. you should open the server in order to make the html file on a web page. 
there has to be a directory to save web page(index.html)
the address would be http://127.0.0.1/index.html
to make other computer access the website: get your ip and make the address into http://(your ip)/index.html --> make sure both computers are using the same network
